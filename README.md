# psycopg2 exploration

This is a "throwaway" repo to explore the API for using psycopg2, particularly around the querying interfaces.

Please see `test_samples.py` for the exploration.

Also, this is verified against a CI build on CircleCI.
Naturally, you can also run this particular CI job build locally.

```sh
# assuming you have the CircleCI CLI installed.

circleci build --job try_psycopg2
```
